Welcome to a personal Neovim configuration! This project aims to show everyone what a Lua configuration for Neovim looks like.
Feel free to open issues if you have suggestions or improvements. This is an ongoing project and I am constantly making
changes and experimenting new things.

# Install

**Prerequisites**

- Neovim 0.8+

Steps:

1. Clone the project in your config folder, usually `~/.config/nvim`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imdiegolopes/nvim  ~/.config/nvim --depth 1 && nvim
```

2. Open Neovim. You should see a _"Downloading packer.."_ and then _"plugins installed"_ message in the first run
